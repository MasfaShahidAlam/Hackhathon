            <p class="para-health">The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the only
                probiotic formulation recommended and recognized by name in
                the American College of Gastroenterology AGA guidelines for the
                management of pouchitis and other pouch related disorders (Olleik
                et al., Gastroenterology, Vol. 164, No. 6, 2023).


                The European Crohn s and Colitis Organization (ECCO) has included
                the De Simone Formulation in its guidelines for the management of
                Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023).

                CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of
                various gastrointestinal conditions. The extensive scientific evidence,
                comprising over 200 peer reviewed articles and more than 80
                controlled clinical studies, ensures that the benefits observed in
                clinical trials are replicable in everyday use</p>

            <h1>Why Does It <span class="highlight">Work?</span></h1>
            <p>
                Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not
                simply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex
                network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human
                host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained
                from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.</p>

            <p>
                CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and
                enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to
                synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract.</p>
            <p>
                It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De Simone falls
                within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product s
                base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific
                knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy.</p>

            <p>
                The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone,
                which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and
                efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate or
                produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.</p>

            Supported by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the
            dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering
            proven and replicable clinical results.</p>

            <h4>CDS22-formula supports the dietary management of intestinal dysbiosis, contributing to well-being in
                cases of intestinal
                disorders connected to irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and paucities.</h4>
            <h3>Control of intestinal dysbiosis:</h3>
            <p>Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestine is
                altered, causing various
                gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for maintaining digestive health, improving
                patient comfort, and contributing
                to overall well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome,
                ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.</p>
            <h3>Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of intestinal dysbiosis. It reduces the
                severity and duration of symptoms,
                improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It is particularly indicated for supporting
                intestinal health and can be beneficial in
                cases of temporary or chronic intestinal disorders characterized by accelerated transit that prevents
                normal daily activities or
                adequate night rest.</p>
            <h3>Variety of Dosages:</h3>
            <p>Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal health and adapt to individual dietary
                needs, offering flexibility to
                healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation.</p>
            <h3>Original Formulation:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique combination of proprietary bacterial strains
                designed to maximize
                intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in proprietary Master Cell Banks,
                ensuring purity, quality, and
                consistency in every production.</p>
            <h3>Guaranteed Safety:</h3>
            <p>Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Thanks to a short supply chain approved
                by the inventor, the
                product maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to packaging.</p>
            <h3>Affordability:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing equivalent quantities of bacteria.
                Efficient production and
                direct cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the market.</p>

            <h1 class="headings">De <span class="highlight">Simone</span> <span
                    style="font-weight: 700; color: rgb(39, 168, 213);">Formulation</span> </h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor
                Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined
                therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high concentration probiotic
                mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic
                gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
            <p>His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal
                flora s role was just beginning to be
                understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and,
                after graduating in Medicine and
                Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious
                Diseases at the University of Lâ€™Aquila (Italy).</p>
            <p>He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.</p>
            <p>Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has
                actively advocated for better regulation and quality
                control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risk</p>
            <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics
                have not been clinically tested or may not
                correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial differences
                in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De
                Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).</p>
            <p>Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in
                manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and
                safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product.</p>
        </div>

            <h1 class="headings">There is ONE <br> De <span class="highlight">Simone</span> <span

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to modify formulations without
                adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public trust.
                In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF) was sold under the brand name VSL#3Â®*, by VSL
                Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.</p>

            <p>In 2019, VSL#3Â® distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more information:Federal Judge
                Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of
                VSL#3, Schulman Bhattacharya). Recently, the European Crohn s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has
                updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature
                references to VSL#3Â® exclusively refer to DSF (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society
                for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) published
                the article â€œClarifying Correct Attributions in Scientific Literature: The Case of the De Simone
                Formulation and VSL#3Â®â€œ, which reiterates the above.</p>
            <p>The De Simone Formulation is sold under the brand name â€œVisbiome in the USA and Canada (Exegi) and under
                the brand name De Simone Formulation in
                Korea (HectoHealthcare).</p>
